# kernel-mis: Computing exact maximum independent sets through kernelization

[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL%20v3.0-blue.svg)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/)

The intent of this software is to provide all necessary code and scripts to reproduce
the results from the following publication:

*On the Power of Simple Reductions for the Maximum Independent Set Problem*,  
**Darren Strash**,  
Proceedings of COCOON 2016. LNCS 9797, pp. 345-356, 2016.  
[doi:10.1007/978-3-319-42634-1_28](https://doi.org/10.1007/10.1007/978-3-319-42634-1_28)  
[arxiv:1608.00724](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00724)

##This package includes:

 - C++ code for implementations of maximum independent set reduction algorithms, including:
  * The critical independent set reduction by [Butenko and Trukhanov](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orl.2006.07.004)
  * The maximum critical independent set reduction by [Larson](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~clarson/r04.pdf)
  * "Simple" reductions: isolated clique removal by [Butenko et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-98096-6_12) and vertex folding by [Chen et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jagm.2001.1186)
 - A small collection of test instances (sample.data.tar.gz)
 - A test script to build and run algorithms on sample data sets, and generate LaTeX tables as output (./test.sh)

Please feel free to contact me with any questions!

### Version
1.0

### Building

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/darrenstrash/kernel-mis.git
$ cd kernel-mis
$ make
```

### Running
```sh
$ ./bin/kernel-mis --input-file=<input graph> --experiment=<kernel-size-simple|kernel-size-critical-set|kernel-size-maximum-critical-set|simple-mcs>
```

or

```sh
$ ./test.sh
```

to run all algorithms on all included data sets. The test script will take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, depending on your system. *Note:* this bash script calls both *python* and *pdflatex* from the command line. Please make sure you have them installed and configured.

### Graph Format

Currently, the unweighted METIS format is expected:

<# vertices> <# edges> 1

followed by <#vertices> lines, where the i-th line contains 
a list of space-separated neighbors of i. All vertices range from 1 to <# vertices>

### Data

sample.data.tar.gz contains a sampling of data sets used in experiments in the paper.

More data is available on request; however, be warned that the full data set is more than 30GB. If there's enough demand, I'll consider making scripts to automatically download/generate all data sets in the expected format.

### What's missing from this package?

Right now, I only include the code that I wrote, and a few data sets. Here's what is missing, and may be added in the future:
 - **Advanced reductions**: these were generated by the implementation by Akiba and Iwata (2016). Their code is available [here](https://github.com/wata-orz/vertex_cover), and must be modified to output the kernel size.
 - **Full data sets**: They're just too big. Contact me if you need them.
